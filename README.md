# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems that I have tackled as part of my training for interviews with FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other tech companies.

## Objective
The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learn from solutions proposed by the community. Additionally, it serves as a useful reference for other programming enthusiasts tackling similar problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Folder by problem number:** Each LeetCode problem is assigned a unique number. Solutions are located in folders numbered according to the problem's assigned number.
- **Source code file:** Within each folder, you will find the source code file containing the implementation of the solution in a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have a different solution or optimization for an existing problem, feel free to submit a [pull request](CONTRIBUTING.md). Additionally, if you come across any errors or issues in any solution, please report them through an [issue](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).


## Legal Disclaimer
This repository is shared with the intention of collaboration and learning. Please note that copying and pasting code directly from this repository without understanding it is not a recommended practice. Use these solutions as a reference and try to comprehend the reasoning behind each implementation.

I hope you find this repository helpful and that it aids in your preparation for technical interviews! Good luck!
